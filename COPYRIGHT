Appendix A.  Charityware

   Health care is a human right often taken for granted in modern
   societies.  However, in many countries, access to quick and
   efficient health care is not a given due to the lack of resources
   or war.

   To help people in need, the author of this software strongly
   encourages anyone benefiting from this software to make a
   donation to Médecins Sans Frontières, an international and an
   independent medical humanitarian organization that provides medical
   assistance all over the world.

   Founded in 1971 in Paris, France, the organization reported to
   have done tens of millions of medical consultations and vaccinated
   millions of children and adults against outbreaks (measles) [1].
